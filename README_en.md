# Rust Hack & Learn, Kyiv

Rust is a new system programming language developed by Mozilla.  Rust was the “most loved programming language” in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey for 4 years in a row (2016–2019).

Join us for a round of hacking and learning Rust!  Pair up and solve some katas, work on your latest Rust project, make an open source contribution, or join the “newbie corner”.

Everyone is welcome, from seasoned programmer to those still seeking an opportunity to write their first line of Rust.  In the latter case, don't worry, we will help you getting set up and going.

## Where

[Chasopys Creative Space](http://www.chasopys.ua/page/events-eng.html), “Library” room.
Lva Tolstogo str, 3, Kyiv.

Note that you will have to pay for the time spent in Chasopys.  The price is 60 UAH per hour, as of April 2019.  Please speak to administrators for details. They can also show you where our group's tables are.

## When

We start every Thursday at 18:30 with a short introduction and then start hacking until 21:00.  From 21:00 to 21:30 there will be time to present your results (if you like) and share your “lessons learned”.

## Requirements

Please bring a laptop, ideally with your favourite editor and a recent Rust stable already installed.  If you can't bring one, you can certainly pair up with someone who brought theirs.
